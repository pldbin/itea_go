Create a program that will receive a request to download content (an archive). The program should have the following components:Concurrent Downloader: A module responsible for downloading the requested archive concurrently to improve performance. It should use channels for communication between the components.Chunker: A module that first decompresses the archive and then divides all the files into chunks of 1 kilobyte in size. It should also use channels for communication with other modules.Acceptor: A module that will receive and process the 1-kilobyte chunks sent through channels.
The goal is to implement a system that can efficiently download, decompress, and process an archive by breaking it down into smaller manageable pieces. The use of concurrency and channels in Golang will improve the overall performance and allow for effective communication between the different modules.
